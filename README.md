# Wod Boss
WodBoss is a tool that helps fitness fanatics track their 
progress and meet their fitness goals by providing a social 
media platform to gather support from your friends and family.

With WodBoss you can record your workouts, spy on your arch rivals 
performances, follow your favorite gym, cheer on your friends, and 
find great workouts to attempt. Exercise can be tough and daunting, 
but with WodBoss it becomes a social experience to remember, all while

Gym owners beware, WodBoss will make your job of tracking members, coaches
